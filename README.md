# gottafixit
Proofread the web for fun and glory.

This repository contains code for the gottafixit server, Google Chrome extension, and the beginnings of a Firefox extension which hasn't been written yet.

To start the server, simply install meteor from http://meteor.com and run `meteor` from the gfi_serv directory. Meteor will automatically install dependancies for the server.

The Chrome extension also requires some dependancies which should be installed using Bower. Run `bower install` from gottafixit/chromeext/js, and the dependancies will be put in gottafixit/chromeext/js/bower_components. You'll need to have an install of bower on your system first. The Chrome extension is also available in the chrome web store.
